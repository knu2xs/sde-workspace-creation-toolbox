SDE Workspace Creation Toolbox
===========================

As a GIS instructor, I have the need to quickly setup, configure and load data for demonstrations. In the last few months I have created an collection of ArcGIS Python script tools to streamline this process.

To hopefully make these tools more widely available, I have shared them here. Also, to facilitate the collaborative nature of GitHub, I have ported this toolbox to an ArcGIS Python toolbox, making it easier for the community (this would be you), to fork and submit pull requests when you see opportunities for improvement  or see the need to add (even) more useful tools.
